#XtoAudio
A simple program I made to change pdf/text into a voice file for when I want to listen on the go or when it's difficult to read.
The default voice is the same as the one used in every AI summary youtube short. It was funny when I found it. 

Simple terminal GUI for now. 

To use, change your Elevenlabs API key in `.env`.
```
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
```
